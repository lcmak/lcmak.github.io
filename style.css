    <p class="rightpara">contrasts with: <br/>
      Pre-set goals or opportunities<br/>

    <p class="leftpara">Expert entrepreneurs limit risk by understanding what they can afford to lose at each step, instead of seeking large all-or-nothing opportunities.  They choose goals and actions where there is upside even if the downside ends up happening.</p>
  <p class="rightpara">contrasts with: <br/>
    Expected return<br/>
    Causal reasoning first targets a return, then works to minimize associated risk.</p><br/>
</li>
  <li>
      <h4 class="greenheading">Lemonade</h4>

    Competitive analysis<br/>
    Causal reasoning presumes that competitors are rivals to contend with.</p><br/>
    </li>

  <h4 class="greenheading">Pilot in the Plane</h4>
    <p>By focusing on activities within their control expert entrepeurs know their actions will result in the desired outcomes.  An effectual worldview is rooted in the belief that the future is neither found nor predicted, but instead is made.</p>
  <p class="rightpara">contrasts with: <br/>
    Inevitable trends<br/>
